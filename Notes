cloud computing -> sharing of computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand.
cloud computing models:
  -> IaaS - has buiding blocks for cloud it like vpc, ec2, ebs
  -> PaaS - amazon manages the underlying infra lile eds, emr, elastic search
  -> SaaS - complete product managed by service provider like web based email, office365 or salesforce.com
cloud computing deployment models:
  -> Cloud
  -> Hybrid
  -> OnPremise
serverless computing -> building apps without thinking of servers at all. FaaS (function) or abstract service like s3, lambda, dynamoDB, sns
aws service categories: too many options like nw, security, msging, analytics

global infrastructure has 16 regions, 42 availibility zones and 50+ edge locations. Not all services are available at all regions.

1. S3 -> basic storage of buckde. endpoint is required to access s3 in a VPC.
2. glacier -> long term data storage. takes time to be available on demand. least cost. glacier can be converted in s3 on demand which can be then accessed afterwards.
3. EBS -> elastic Block storage to attach to a single server
4. Storage Gateway -> High speed conenctivity via nw for on premoise server
5. EFS -> elastic file storage like NAS storage for multiple server access. efs mount target is required to access efs from outside of VPC - virtual private cloud 
6. Import export snowball -> upload data on aws physical device and then they will use it to put it online in aws

e.g. disaster recovery with aws will have snowball service first to be send to aws for first connection and then aws storage gateway for increamental storage update.
