11-10-19 Fri -- Introduction

cloud computing -> sharing of computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand.
cloud computing models:
  -> IaaS - has buiding blocks for cloud it like vpc, ec2, ebs
  -> PaaS - amazon manages the underlying infra lile eds, emr, elastic search
  -> SaaS - complete product managed by service provider like web based email, office365 or salesforce.com
cloud computing deployment models:
  -> Cloud
  -> Hybrid
  -> OnPremise
serverless computing -> building apps without thinking of servers at all. FaaS (function) or abstract service like s3, lambda, dynamoDB, sns
aws service categories: too many options like nw, security, msging, analytics

global infrastructure has 16 regions, 42 availibility zones and 50+ edge locations. Not all services are available at all regions.

14-10-19 Mon -- Storage

1. S3 -> basic storage of buckde. endpoint is required to access s3 in a VPC.
2. glacier -> long term data storage. takes time to be available on demand. least cost. glacier can be converted in s3 on demand which can be then accessed afterwards.
3. EBS -> elastic Block storage to attach to a single server
4. Storage Gateway -> High speed conenctivity via nw for on premoise server
5. EFS -> elastic file storage like NAS storage for multiple server access. efs mount target is required to access efs from outside of VPC - virtual private cloud 
6. Import export snowball -> upload data on aws physical device and then they will use it to put it online in aws

e.g. disaster recovery with aws will have snowball service first to be send to aws for first connection and then aws storage gateway for increamental storage update.

15-10-19 Tues -- DB

RDS - mysql  managed by amazon
Aurora - enterprice class paid db (ms sql, oracle, postgres)
dynamo db - just create table, no need to manage db related things
elasti cache - cache memory for frequently used data
redshift - postgres db for data warehouse
aws db migration service - from on prem or cloud db to aws db

e.g. db migration servide used to connect onsite db and then put it in oracle rds db instance. elasti cache node is used to cache the data and will be used to put up front so all request go through it.

practial labs include creating db in aws console and accessing it via any db client e.g. oracle sql developer or cmd line utility.

16-10-19 Wed -- Compute

Compute services and nw and content delivery services. Running code in server. IaaS

1) Compute
EC2 - Elastic compute cloud, any server like linux or windows with e.g. web service
ELB - Elastic load balancing, distribute requests or load
ECS - Elastic container service, launching services with docker container with all infra ready for use
AutoScaling - autoscaling group by adding services or servers based on demand
Elastic Beanstalk - supply code and it'll do what needs to be done for it without us getting involved. Uses e.g. EC2 in backend for deployement.
Lambda - serverless environment to run any code in it based on milisecond of running

vertical scaling is getting big (high end) server for the same app and horizontal scaling is adding more servers of same type. Load balancer will distribute the request to servers based on load. if the request get more than the environment is able to handle, the addition or removal of servers will be done on demand. 

2) Nw and Content delivery
VPC - private private cloud, space or network within amazon nw
Direct Connect - high speed access to aws cloud
CloudFront - CDN in aws, high speed low latency. It also has cache which will server most used data without putting the requests in the actual servers or ELB.
ELB - distribute the load
Route 53 - route requests in domain

nw hirarchy - AWS cloud -> Region -> availablity zone -> VPC -> ELB and EC2, etc

multi availibility zone distrubutes the load based on regions. if one goes down, requests can be routed to next available zone infra. route 53 will be used to route traffic through the dns service. aws direct connect will connect inhouse db to this infra in aws.

use LAMP with wordpress app. AMI is amazon machine image (basically a server with the os and other infra basically set up). select assign public ip for access outside the aws. select wordpress instance. lauch the instance without the key-pair to connect to it directly. copy the ip in broswer and we are ready to go!
